				-- <br> <br> ABOUT ME <br> <br> 
			</h3>
		<p3> 
			<br> Hi! <br> <br> My name is Kathryn Arenson. I am currently a senior at UW-Madison studying Consumer Behavior <br> and Marketplace Studies and will graduate in May 2023. Over the years, I have gained a variety of <br>experiences that have provided me with an outstanding foundation of knowledge. My positions have ranged from <br> being a sailing director, to interning in Marketing and HR. I am confident that the skills I established have prepared <br> me for a seemless transition to a career after graduation.  In addition to my work experience, one of my passions is being an adrenaline outdoor junkie. I enjoy activities such as hiking, skiing, and sailing.
